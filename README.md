### Introduction
This is a list of categorized domains, with additional entries for wildcard blocking.  The domains are documented as to keep a record of what is being blocked or allowed.  The primary focus is to maximize blocking unwanted hosts while **guaranteeing** not to break any useful services or legitimate websites.  

Each domain is only added after through research and tests in order to make sure it should be _intentionally blocked_.

### Sources
The domain entries on this list are hand-picked, and mainly added by analyzing the traffic generated by the devices I use.  I intend to focus on domains related to _both_ websites and mobile apps.  This will include the obvious pop-ups and pop-unders, frame-based ads, 3<sup>rd</sup> party image and video ads, mobile in-app banners -- as well as hidden tracking and other unnecessary bloated spyware that is ususally bundled with common apps that are downloaded, and the websites you visit.

### Format
This list is available in **domains-only** format at the moment, which is compatible with:
- [**<img height=32 align=middle src="https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Vortex/Vortex_with_Wordmark.svg"> Pi-hole**](https://pi-hole.net/) and/or [**<img height=32 align=middle src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/master/logo.png"> DNScrypt-proxy**](https://simplednscrypt.org/).
- [**<img height=24 align=middle src="http://www.squid-cache.org/favicon.ico"> Squid**](http://www.squid-cache.org/) proxy ([Windows downloads](http://squid.diladele.com/), [How-to use](http://www.thedumbterminal.co.uk/posts/2005/10/blocking_access_to_sites_when_using_squid.html))
- [**<img height=24 align=middle src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/icon38@2x.png"> uBlock Origin**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and/or [**<img width=24 align=middle src="https://adblockplus.org/favicon.ico"> Adblock Plus**](https://adblockplus.org/download)
- [**<img height=24 align=middle src="https://adguard.com/img/favicons/favicon.ico"> AdGuardHome**](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#getting-started)

You can use it on either a server, or using browser extensions, you can filter sites on the client side.

Read **[Olivier Butterbach](https://github.com/obutterbach)**'s excellent post on Medium to set up Pi-hole:

### Aggregated lists
The following aggregated lists automatically includes the domains in my lists.  You can use the aggregated lists such as:
- **[1Hosts (Pro)](https://github.com/badmojr/1Hosts/tree/master/Pro)** ‚Äì includes `adservers-and-trackers` and `unwanted-iranian` lists
- **[oisd.nl](https://oisd.nl/?p=dl)** ‚Äì only includes `unwanted-iranian` list

I used to use [this](https://github.com/zeffy/dnscrypt-lists/blob/9d776690e901e106ea5707e4c83f73a07ed2470d/script/make_blacklist.py) python script alongside DNScrypt on my VPS instead of running Pi-hole.

**‚úç Note:**  You're welcome to use and include my lists in your aggregated lists and redistribute them.  Please [tell me](https://github.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/issues/new?title=Mention+my+list) if you do so, so I can mention your list here as well.

### Blacklist Domains

| **Activation servers**                  | Blocks license verification and software activation.<br/><sup>This list is intended to prevent products from expiring when they detect an invalid license.</sup> | [üìù `activation.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/master/domains/blacklist/activation.txt) | _n/a_ |
| **Fake domains**                        | Blocks copycat, scam and fake domains that imitate other well-known websites, for various reasons. | [üìù `fake-domains.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/master/domains/blacklist/fake-domains.txt) | _n/a_ |

### Whitelist Domains
I intent to also publish the whitelists that I use, which are also hand-picked.  The `whitelist` _will_ be published under the [üìÅ `/domains/whitelist`](https://github.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/blob/master/domains/blacklist/fake-domains.txt) folder, when released.  In the meantime, please contact me if you want me to publish my whitelist sooner.

### Sources to use alongside mine
These are some of the other lists that you should _definitely_ be using alongside with mine:

    `https://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=hosts&showintro=1&mimetype=plaintext`
- [Dan Pollock‚Äôs hosts file](https://someonewhocares.org/hosts/):

    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts`

### Report domains
If you notice any domains that you believe should be included in my lists, please report it to me [here](issues/new).  

A great deal of care is taken to avoid any type of false positives.  However, in the event that you see something legitamate is being blocked, missing content and/or breaking functionality, please report false positives by creating an issue [here](issues/new).

This could be because the domain names that serve those type of ads could potentially be also used to serve legitimate content, which means blocking them will result in an app or website missing content or losing functionality.

These lists are personaly used by me, with no side-effects.  I have kept the lists short and lightweight, while adding as much as possible to each list.

### Updates
In order to get notified of an update, you can mark my repository as "watched".  I update this list on a weekly or monthly basis.

This is a list of categorized domains, with additional entries for wildcard blocking.  The primary focus is to **guarantee** not to break any useful services or legitimate websites.  Each domain is only added after through research and tests in order to make sure it should _intentionally be blocked_.

I intend to focus on _both_ websites and mobile domains.

### Format
This list is available in **domains-only** format at the moment, which is compatible with:
- [**<img height=32 align=middle src="https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Vortex/Vortex_with_Wordmark.svg"> Pi-hole**](https://pi-hole.net/) and/or [**<img height=32 align=middle src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/master/logo.png"> DNScrypt-proxy**](https://simplednscrypt.org/).
- [**<img height=24 align=middle src="http://www.squid-cache.org/favicon.ico"> Squid**](http://www.squid-cache.org/) proxy ([Windows downloads](http://squid.diladele.com/), [How-to use](http://www.thedumbterminal.co.uk/posts/2005/10/blocking_access_to_sites_when_using_squid.html))
- [**<img height=24 align=middle src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/icon38@2x.png"> uBlock Origin**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) and/or [**<img width=24 align=middle src="https://adblockplus.org/favicon.ico"> Adblock Plus**](https://adblockplus.org/download)

You can use it on either a server, or within browser plugins, so you can filter sites on the client side.

Read **[Olivier Butterbach](https://github.com/obutterbach)**'s excellent post on Medium to set up Pihole:

### Aggregated lists
The following aggregated lists automatically includes the domains in my lists.  You can use the aggregated lists such as:
- **[1Hosts (Pro)](https://github.com/badmojr/1Hosts/tree/master/Pro)** ‚Äì includes `adservers-and-trackers` and `unwanted-iranian` lists
- **[oisd.nl](https://oisd.nl/?p=dl)** ‚Äì only includes `unwanted-iranian` list

I used to use [this](https://github.com/zeffy/dnscrypt-lists/blob/9d776690e901e106ea5707e4c83f73a07ed2470d/script/make_blacklist.py) python script alongside DNScrypt on my VPS instead of running Pi-hole.

**‚úç Note:**  You're welcome to use and include my lists in your aggregated lists and redistribute them.  Please [tell me](https://github.com/DRSDavidSoft/additional-hosts/issues/new?title=Mention+my+list) if you do so, so I can mention your list here as well.

### Report domains
If you notice any domains that you believe should be included in my lists, please report it to me [here](issues/new).  

### Note
A great deal of care is taken to avoid any type of false positives.  However, in the event that you see something legitamate is being blocked, missing content and/or breaking functionality, please report false positives by creating an issue [here](issues/new).

This could be because the domain names that serve those type of ads could potentially be also used to serve legitimate content, which means blocking them will result in an app or website missing content or losing functionality.

### Updates
